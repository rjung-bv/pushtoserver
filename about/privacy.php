              <li>(iv) To any third-party service providers who are hired by BoardVantage to provide services to BoardVantage related to the provision of the Services; provided, that we require these parties to maintain the confidentiality of your information and disclose it only as necessary for them to provide their services.
              <li>(v) If required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (1) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on BoardVantage or the Service; (2) protect and defend the rights or property of BoardVantage; or (3) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of BoardVantage, its web site(s), product or services or the public from harm or harassment.

            <h4>8. Financial Institution Users</h4>
            <p>
            BoardVantage is not a financial institution and does not have consumer customer relationships as defined by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (the "Act"). However, to the extent that BoardVantage acts as a service provider to a financial institution and such financial institution provides consumers' nonpublic personal information to BoardVantage, the Act requires that financial institutions must either make a full disclose to customers or permit consumers to opt-out of such disclosure. If you are a user that is using the Service as an employee, officer, director or agent of a financial institution, you agree to comply with the Act and applicable regulations.  Accordingly, if you disclose consumer information to BoardVantage in connection with your use of the Service, you will first ensure that the financial institution that you represent has provided notice of any such disclosure to the applicable consumers or an option to opt-out of such disclosure, in accordance with the Act and then obtain BoardVantage's consent to receipt of such information under the requirements of the Act.  Any such consumer information that BoardVantage agrees to receive must be identified as consumer information, and BoardVantage will use such consumer information solely to perform services for the financial institution and will not use or disclose such information in a manner prohibited by the Act and applicable regulations.  
            </p>
            
            
            <h4>9. Payment Processing</h4>
            <p>
            BoardVantage does not process payments for services on the website. 
            </p>
            
            
            <h4>10. Access</h4>

            <h4>11. The Security of Your Information.</h4>
            <p>We use security measures (such as encryption technology) to protect your information including the Personally Identifiable Information that we transmit and store. BoardVantage employs the following measures to secure data:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>(i) Database level security &mdash; measures designed to prevent unauthorized users from accessing or modifying the data at the database level.
              <li>(ii) System level security &mdash; measures designed to prevent unauthorized access to the systems that the database runs on, and to all systems that can access the database.
              <li>(iii) Network level security &mdash; The database is designed to be inaccessible to the public Internet. No machine that can directly access the database can be directly accessed from the Internet.
              <li>(iv) Firewall &mdash; designed to prevent unauthorized access to the network, and to protect against attacks.
              <li>(v) Intrusion Detection systems &mdash; designed to alert us to any attack that might get past the network security and firewall, so that the attack can be stopped.
              <li>(vi) Physical security &mdash; Measures designed to ensure that the machines that can access the database are physically secured so that only the operations team can access them.
            </ol>
            <p>
            We also prohibit our employees from accessing your Personally Identifiable Information except on a need to know basis, and even then only under confidentiality agreements. Our engineers review the security measures on a regular basis to update and strengthen these protections.
            No security measures are completely fail-safe or impervious to circumvention. We are not responsible for events beyond our control, including without limitation, the malicious acts or willful misconduct of hackers or any other person.
