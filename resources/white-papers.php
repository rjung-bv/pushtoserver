                 <p>The growing adoption of board portals represents a transformation in every aspect of how boards function and communicate. Using the iPad technology, board portals simplify and improve the user experience, create immediacy in online communication, while maintaining a secure environment. The transition from paper to portal can be easily achieved by understanding traditional obstacles and following simple steps from initial inquiry to full implementation and a paperless boardroom.</p>

                  <p>Technology is no stranger in the boardroom but its impact has been muted. That is  now changing. After years of scattered adoption, there is now rapid sector growth, director advocacy of technology, and the paperless boardroom has become a reality. The iPad is the visible trigger but there are plenty of other factors in the mix. Collectively they're driving a shift from access-only portals to platforms with the depth and breadth necessary to meet growing demands for mobility, high-caliber security and interactivity that boards and leadership teams rely on.</p>

                  <p>Typical collaboration tools are often readily adaptable in the lower levels of the enterprise. But executives face a degree of role complexity that does not exist among the rank and file. That's why the NextGen architecture segregates sensitive communication streams&mdash;by initiative&mdash;centralizing relevant activity inside ring-fenced TeamSpaces. This allows direct and open communication within a secure, team-specific environment.</p>
