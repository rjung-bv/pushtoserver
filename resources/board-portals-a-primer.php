              <h4>A Visual Experience</h4> -->
              <p class="col-sm-6" style="padding: 0;">
                Technology is fundamentally changing the way modern boards communicate. Traditionally, board communications have been paper, fax and then e-mail-based. Companies sent out board books in advance of meetings, and directors met in person to discuss agenda topics. Until a few years ago, this approach to managing communications was sufficient.
                </p>
                <p class="col-sm-6" style="padding: 0;">Today, however, things have changed considerably. More regulatory scrutiny, greater globalization, deeper competitive pressures, and more active shareholders have dramatically increased the volume of board work. It is also no secret that a great deal of board work now takes place between meetings, rather than during meetings.
              </p>
              <p class="col-sm-12" style="padding: 0;">
                Given this changing environment, old school paper processes have run out of steam. They are simply too slow and cumbersome to keep up with the pace of today's board work. Further, they are not secure. Board books are routinely left in taxicabs, and faxes of merger agreements get lost in hotels or are even sent to the wrong fax number.
                </p>
                <p class="col-sm-12" style="padding: 0;">To deal with the speed of today's board communications, many boards are adopting board portals. Board portals give directors greater visibility into operations, streamline board book creation, and tighten information security.

              <h3 class="blue">What is a Board Portal?</h3>
              <p>A board portal is a secure app or website designed explicitly for the purpose of facilitating communication between directors and the company. The current generation of portals supports information exchange and captures the process that takes place in meetings and in between meetings. There are three major attributes in a board portal: a) online access for directors, b) toolkit for the corporate secretary and c) security which meets or exceeds the standards of the IT organization. Directors access the portal from a browser or an iPad - but the iPad is overwhelmingly the device of choice today.

              <h3 class="blue">Brief History of Board Portals</h3>
              <img class="img-responsive" src="../img/adoption-boardroom-tech955x240.png">
              <h4>Initially, all about Access : The Electronic Board Book</h4>
              <p>
                Unlike other recent business applications, board portals were not part of the Dotcom phenomenon of the late nineties. They are a more recent development with the first vendors releasing products in the early 2000's.
              </p>
              <p>There were two factors that propelled market development. The first was a cadre of progressive directors who, enthusiastic about technology and weary of bulky board books, advocated electronic access to meeting materials. The term used by them was "electronic board book", an apt description given the rather primitive solutions in existence, which did little more than provide rudimentary online access.
              </p>
              <p>The second driver was the passage of the 2002 Sarbanes-Oxley act. This major piece of legislation, written in response to the accounting scandals of that time, threw a spotlight on board portals as a vehicle to drive governance.
              </p>
              <p>
              At BoardVantage we recognized the value of Technology in Corporate Governance, but never regarded technology as a substitute, recognizing that corporate governance is ultimately a matter of expertise, ethics and transparency.
              </p>
              <p>Taking a pragmatic approach to the role for technology, our focus was increasing director visibility and improving timely access to information. That meant investments in alerting, securing email and Web conferencing. This approach has been validated, as online access has proved its staying power while governance faded as purchase justification for board portals.
              </p>
              <p>Demand came from surprising corners. Contrary to popular expectation, it was strongest from brick-and-mortar companies, not the tech sector. Also, large enterprises, typically perceived as conservative, were among the early adopters. Despite this contrarian trend, overall demand remained modest because product functionality was inadequate for widespread adoption.
                            </p>
              <h4>From Access to Process: The Board Portal</h4>
              <p>
                It wasn't until 2005 that the category found its footing. Technology matured, buying criteria solidified, and naturally purchasing increased. Around this time, the term 'electronic board book' became passe while the term 'board portal' emerged and is in use to this day. This reclassification was an implicit acknowledgment that newer technology could do much more than provide simple electronic access to board materials.
              </p>
              <p>
                Driven by customer requests, BoardVantage made major technology investments to stay ahead of the trend. Product enhancements allowed capturing virtually all aspects of board process including written consents and director questionnaires. We launched the corporate secretary toolkit with dashboards to manage and tally director input. We shipped an agenda builder for creation of an online agenda and assembly of a board book from Word. By 2007, we had re-engineered our product from top-to-bottom and had Web-enabled all board process as it was practiced inside a typical Fortune-500 company. With this second generation board portal, a General Counsel could provide the board with access to board materials AND support process at, as well as in-between, meetings.
              </p>
              <p>
                Other material developments during that time included improvements in the process aspects of security architectures and the initiation of SAS70 audits. After this rapid series of advances the board portal space entered a maturing phase (albeit temporarily) where customers were satisfied to absorb the improvements in their organizational process.
              </p>
              <h4>From Process to Collaboration: The Cross-Over</h4>
              <p>
                In 2007 we noticed a change in demand. Up until that time board portals were strictly used by directors 'inside the boardroom'. Requests to deploy the service for applications 'outside the boardroom' emerged. Driven by a growing need to include senior executives in boardroom conversations as well as the desire for executives to collaborate more closely among themselves, companies were reaching out for something better than email.
              </p>
              <p>This was surprising initially, but on closer scrutiny, it became clear that the way boards work isn't dramatically different from the way most executives do. Like directors, executives depend on a steady flow of information, are often mobile, and obtain their information from an eclectic network of sources. In an increasingly fast-paced world, gaining timely access to that information is a growing concern.
              </p>
              <p>Compounding the issue is that the information is confidential and is held under some form of process control. Trying to tackle this problem with only email had begun to fall short. A board portal on the other hand, with its built-in security, ease-of-use, and document management, had obvious inherent advantages to address these needs.
              </p>
              <p>The new demand came with its challenges. As much as there are similarities in the way that boards work there are also material differences. For example, as a group, executives are far more tech-savvy than board members. Also, whereas board process is relatively constant across industries, when it comes to executives, there's significant process variation from company to company.
               </p>

                <h4>Take-Aways</h4>
              <p>
                Technology is no stranger in the board room but its impact has been muted. That is changing. After years of scattered adoption, there is now rapid sector growth, director advocacy of technology, and the paperless boardroom has be come a reality
</p><p>The iPad is the visible trigger but there are plenty of other factors in the mix. Collectively they’re driving a shift from access-only portals to platforms with the depth and breadth necessary to meet growing demands for mobility, high-caliber security and interactivity that boards and leadership teams rely on today.
</p><p>Organizations still need online access to board materials but they have added executive collaboration as a new criterion. No longer is the platform just for the board. It now must serve the leadership team and beyond. 
              </p>

               <h3 class="blue">What to Look for in Board Portal Technology</h3>
              <p>
                It's worth pointing out now that going paperless raises the bar on what's required from the software platform. Keep in mind that, pre-iPad, tech-savvy directors had already used technology for simple online access to their boardbooks, a technically uncomplicated task. But, as discussed in How Tablets Are Creating Paperless Board Meetings, readability on paper being better than on laptops prevented paperless boardroom from becoming desirable.
              </p>
              <p>As a device, iPad bested paper in terms of readability. Post-iPad, boards across a wide range of organizations set more ambitious goals. Their directors asked for more than just document access and many made the shift quickly. Today these boards do their written consents, including e-signatures on the iPad. They use secure collaboration for committee work, they communicate between meetings with secure email and GCs have discontinued the distribution of printed boardbooks. They have gone paperless.
              </p>
              <p>This of course begs the question: "What should I look for in a portal technology?" With that in mind here are five product attributes that are must-haves for a successful outcome:
              </p>
              <ol style="margin: 20px 10%;">
              <li><p>
                  <strong>Online-Offline Syncing: </strong>Directors carry their iPads wherever they go and rely on them for access to their board materials. Not unreasonably, they expect ready access to those materials even if they're out of Wi-Fi range. An essential requirement is briefcase technology that syncs content seamlessly between online and offline so any notes made while offline are immediately available when a director is back online. Also, to ensure directors have the latest information, the system lets the general counsel push new materials directly to the director's briefcase.
</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Protect Against Discoverability: </strong>The iPad is a groundbreaking mobile device, but there is a tension between mobility and the risk of discoverability. Having the board book on a director's iPad creates a potential legal exposure because directors may forget to purge this information. The way to eliminate this risk is with a system that centralizes control with the general counsel so that downloaded content, and directors' notes, can be purged remotely by the general counsel, without relying on the actions of directors. This is akin to the traditional practice of the general counsel collecting and shredding paper board books following the meeting.
</p></li><li><p><strong>Online Equivalent to Paper Process: </strong>Board communication is characterized by varying levels of access to sections of the boardbook. For example, what members of the audit committee see is often different than what members of the governance committee see, or outside counsel may be added for a single meeting and then her access rights revoked. In other words, a big part of board communication is about who sees what and when they see it. Today, that control exists with paper. It may be onerous, expensive and slow, but it works. It is critical then that the portal has an equivalent ability to differentiate access between various users. In the portal this comes in the form of a control matrix and content segregation.
</p></li><li><p><strong>An Experience that is Better than Paper: </strong>When you change a long-standing process, you have to offer people an incentive. What you give them has to be better than what they have today. That means the user experience for your directors has to be more engaging and satisfying than what exists with paper. This requires an application that takes maximum advantage of the rich graphics and animation of the iPad to improve directors' entire boardroom experience.
</p></li><li><p><strong>Embrace Two-Way Communication: </strong>For years, the board portal was a one-way communication tool. The general counsel distributed materials and directors retrieved it online and rarely communicated back. Now portals are shifting to two-way interactive capabilities that can improve decision-making by providing greater efficiency but also allowing directors to focus on the substantive issues rather than minutiae.
