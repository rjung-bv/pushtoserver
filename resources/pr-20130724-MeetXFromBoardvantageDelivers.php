					  <hr style="margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:25px;">
				  	        <p><strong>Menlo Park, CA (July 24, 2013) </strong> &mdash; Consumer-grade file sharing services have become the unofficial business file sync applications inside many organizations.  Yet for leadership teams, who need to manage strategic initiatives, these unsecure services are unfit for confidential corporate content and processes that accompany the work at leadership levels.</p>
